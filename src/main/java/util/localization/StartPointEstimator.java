/**
 * Interface for classes that are able to provide a start point for the parameters
 * of a curve fitting problem on image data. 
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface are used to pass <i>a priori</i> knowledge
 * to fitting problems. They are specific to a particular class of problems, 
 * and required to provide for two values:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li> They must be able to provide a domain size. That is the size of the image
 * patch around the peak to fit, and whose content is to be used in the fit.
 * 	<li> They must be able to provide a starting point to the curve fitting solver,
 * based on the image data around the coarse peak location.
 * </ul>
 * Depending on the problem they are taylored for, implementations can be very crude:
 * One can return plain constants if the typical parameters of all peaks are known
 * and uniform. Refined method are also possible. 
 * <p>
 * Start point parameters are returned in a double array; it is therefore important
 * the meaning and order of each element in the returned array is the same as the
 * one expected by the curve fitter that will be used downstream.
